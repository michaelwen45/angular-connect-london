# What's new in TypeScript

## Inference
TypeScript uses type inference all the type

## Get correct typings
TypeScript walks the node_modules folder tree.

## Decorators
Can be used to introduce logging easily...

## Reflection
Reflect.getMetadataKeys(ClassName);

## Async/await
Supported with ES6 emit. Means that a second transpilation step is necessary until browsers support this.
